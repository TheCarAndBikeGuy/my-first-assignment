# my-first-assignment

I believe I have met the background images, the vh, absolute and fixed positioning. I tried to achieve every goal possible and incorperate different things I have learnt in a week of being on this course. I believe I didnt incorperate flex box but this is due to it not being needed in my assignment. I found the header difficult as I could not work out how to position the home and so on. I also had some difficulty with working out how to lay the table out but that was up to me to work out. 

I believe I designed the pictures well, and layed it out well making sure that the colours and the text makes sense together. I searched on different sites about the facts and I used W3schools to help with my table, and the underlining of my header.
