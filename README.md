# my-first-assignment 
F1 Webpage

I believe I have met the background images, the vh, flex-box, absolute and fixed positioning. I tried to achieve every goal possible and incorperate different things I have learnt in a week of being on this course. I believe I did not add as much facts and details as I could have done, I tried to incorperate each of the criterias. but I do feel as though I could have added more detail. I found the header difficult as I could not work out how to position the navbar. I also had some difficulty with working out how to lay the table out but that was up to me to work out. I designed the pictures well, and layed it out well making sure that the colours and the text makes sense together. I searched on different sites about the facts and I used W3schools to help with my table, and the underlining of my header. I decided to sort out a Figma to work on my skills this is what the webpage looks like, https://www.figma.com/board/1mKO8Cjyon5Tx3hwyJofIw/Beauty-Of-F1?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=y9BtkGJbtVToLVLZ-0
