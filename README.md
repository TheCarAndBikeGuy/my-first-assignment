# my-first-assignment

This is the Figma board I created to show what it looks like and to get my practice in on Figma - https://www.figma.com/board/1mKO8Cjyon5Tx3hwyJofIw/Beauty-Of-F1?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=SLmcbR7mi5u79QGQ-0

This is the deployment of the website - https://thecarandbikeguy.github.io/my-first-assignment/

I believe I have met the background images, the vh, flex-box, absolute and fixed positioning. I tried to achieve every goal possible and incorporate different things I have learned in a week of being on this course. I believe I didn't add as much facts and details as I could have done, I tried to incorporate each of the criteria. but I do feel as though I could have added more detail. I found the header difficult as I could not work out how to position the home and so on. I also had some difficulty with working out how to lay the table out but that was up to me to work out. 

I believe I designed the pictures well, and layed it out well making sure that the colours and the text makes sense together. I searched on different sites about the facts and I used W3schools to help with my table, and the underlining of my header.
